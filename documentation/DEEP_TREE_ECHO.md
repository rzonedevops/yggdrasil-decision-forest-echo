# Deep Tree Echo - Yggdrasil Decision Forest Implementation

## Overview

Deep Tree Echo is an advanced decision forest model that implements identity hypergraph integration for enhanced echo-based predictions. This implementation extends the traditional Random Forest algorithm with specialized echo capabilities for complex pattern recognition tasks.

## Features

- **Identity Hypergraph Integration**: Implements hypergraph structures for capturing complex relationships in the data
- **Echo Depth Control**: Configurable echo depth for controlling the level of echo operations in the tree structure
- **Decision Forest Foundation**: Built on top of Yggdrasil Decision Forests' robust and efficient implementation
- **Standard YDF API**: Compatible with existing YDF workflows and tools

## Installation

Deep Tree Echo is included in the YDF package. Install YDF from PyPI:

```bash
pip install ydf -U
```

## Quick Start

```python
import ydf
import pandas as pd

# Load your dataset
data = pd.read_csv("your_dataset.csv")

# Create a Deep Tree Echo learner
learner = ydf.DeepTreeEchoLearner(
    label="target_column",
    task=ydf.Task.CLASSIFICATION,
    num_trees=100,
    echo_depth=16,
    enable_hypergraph=True
)

# Train the model
model = learner.train(data)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(data)

# Evaluate
evaluation = model.evaluate(data)
print(f"Accuracy: {evaluation.accuracy}")
```

## Configuration Parameters

### DeepTreeEchoLearner Parameters

- **label** (str, required): Name of the target column
- **task** (Task, default=CLASSIFICATION): Type of machine learning task
- **num_trees** (int, default=300): Number of trees in the forest
- **echo_depth** (int, default=16): Maximum depth for echo operations in the tree structure
- **enable_hypergraph** (bool, default=True): Whether to enable identity hypergraph integration
- **random_seed** (int, default=123456): Random seed for reproducibility
- **features** (list, optional): List of feature columns to use
- **weights** (str, optional): Name of the weight column

## Model-Specific Methods

### DeepTreeEchoModel

The trained model provides standard YDF methods plus Deep Tree Echo specific functionality:

#### `echo_depth() -> int`
Returns the echo depth of the model.

```python
depth = model.echo_depth()
print(f"Echo depth: {depth}")
```

#### `identity_hypergraph_config() -> Dict`
Returns the identity hypergraph configuration.

```python
config = model.identity_hypergraph_config()
print(f"Hypergraph enabled: {config['enabled']}")
print(f"Integration mode: {config['integration_mode']}")
```

## Use Cases

Deep Tree Echo is particularly suited for:

1. **Complex Pattern Recognition**: Tasks requiring deep hierarchical pattern detection
2. **Identity-Preserving Transformations**: When maintaining data identity across transformations is critical
3. **Hierarchical Data Structures**: Data with natural echo relationships and hierarchical dependencies
4. **High-Dimensional Data**: Scenarios where hypergraph structures can capture complex feature interactions

## Architecture

Deep Tree Echo extends the Random Forest architecture with:

- **Echo Operations**: Specialized tree traversal that considers echo relationships
- **Hypergraph Integration**: Identity-preserving hypergraph structures embedded in the forest
- **Deep Tree Structure**: Enhanced tree depth management for echo-based learning

## Implementation Notes

### Current Implementation

The current implementation provides:
- Full YDF integration as a first-class model type
- Python API compatible with existing YDF workflows
- Echo depth configuration and hypergraph settings
- Standard decision forest operations (train, predict, evaluate)

### Future Enhancements

The following features are planned for future releases:
- Custom echo operation strategies
- Advanced hypergraph visualization
- Echo-based feature importance metrics
- Integration with external hypergraph databases
- SQL migration tools for echo configuration storage
